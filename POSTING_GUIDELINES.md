# Steemhunt Posting Guidelines

Steemhunt is a ranking community run by early-adopters who hunt "effortlessly cool products." Please follow these guidelines when making a post. If your post fails to follow these guidelines, it may be excluded from the ranking by the moderators.

## 1. Post a "Product," not a "Business."
A business is larger and more vague than a product. For example, you may post a new Samsung Galaxy S9 phone - this is a product. You can’t post "Samsung" itself - this is a business. Also, you can’t post a local product. Steemhunt is a global community, so you should bring something that everyone can enjoy.

## 2. Types of Products to Post
Steemhunt generally covers unique IT or hardware products, including:
* Web services
* Mobile apps
* API, IT solutions, bots, open sources or other types of software
* Tech gadgets, hardware, IoT/connected/wearable devices
* Games
* Innovative Engineering/Design Products

## 3. Product Link
We only accept these four product links:
1. Official product website
2. Crowdfunding sites (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc)


We do not accept any other product links including e-commerce sites ( e.g. Amazon, ebay, etc.), affiliate marketing sites (e.g. Canopy, Awesome Invention, etc.), newspaper or blog articles, and social media posts, etc.

Also, hunters must put the official product website as a main priority. If you’ve listed an app store or Kickstarter link when the product has an official website, moderators can ask you to change it.

Regarding KickStarter & Indiegogo: if the project was not funded, it won't be accepted on SteemHunt.

Lastly, the product link website must be written in proper English, and use modern website standards like HTML5. Older standards (like HTML 4 or Adobe flash) will be checked and may be hidden by moderators.

## 4. Language - English Only
Steemhunt runs a single ranking board globally, so please post and comment in English. The product website should also be in English.

## 5. Plagiarism and Copyrights
Write a short description and hunter’s comment with your own words. Do not copy and paste from the product’s website or other sites. You can however quote some content from a site, but you must use quotation marks and cite the source properly.

## 6. Post "New" Products
Steemhunt is about cool "new" products. Please make sure that your hunt is something recently introduced. If the product is not new, there must be a strong reason to post. For example, the product must be substantially updated or upgraded in a way that has a positive effect on users. Even though the set period of time to define whether it is newly launched is subjective, the moderators may ask if the product is widely considered to be a “new product” (or substantially updated).


## 8. Quality of the Post
As a hunter, you need to post a cool product with well-structured comments and screenshots so that the users can see the benefit of the product quickly without needing to check the products website. Your post will be hidden if you:
* use non-related words/descriptions about the product.
* attach non-related screenshot images or videos.
* attach low quality product images.
* share any scams or highly suspicious cryptocurrency/fin-tech products.
* share porn or anything under the #nsfw category.
* share illegal products.
* share an ICO which currently has no live product.
* share a product that is no longer available (except for pre-order stage).

## 9. No Duplication Allowed
Steemhunt does not allow the same product to be posted twice. The website automatically checks the URL, but it is still your responsibility to check that the product has not been posted earlier. If your product has already been featured from the same brand, the duplication is allowed only when:
1. The product is a newer model (V2) or has been majorly updated from the original one.
2. They are both main products (not accessories or sub-products).

## 10. Post Only Main Products
When it comes to a maker/brand, they usually have main and sub product. Steemhunt allows only the main product lines from the maker. For example, you cannot post an iPad Smart Cover because it is not from its main product line. However, you may be able to post an innovative iPad Smart Cover from a renowned accessory brand like Belkin because it is the brand's main product line (but in this case your product may not be under "cool product" in section 7).

## 11. Games
There are countless games worldwide, and many of them have narrow target customers. If we accept all new games in Steemhunt, our ranking board may be dominated by games. So, Steemhunt will only accept games that are:
* downloadable/purchasable from major app stores or console game markets
* a game platform itself, rather than a single game inside the platform.

These specific types of games will not be acceptable:
* A single arcade game
* A single flash / HTML game
* A generic gambling game

With respect to “new” games we will consider them based on the original title’s release date. No other release dates based on additions of new platforms or newly released patches will be considered.

## Moderation
All hunts posted on Steemhunt.com are verified by Steemhunt moderators first. Once our moderators check that your hunt meets all the criteria in the posting guidelines, your hunt will be approved and considered for the ranking competition and @steemhunt's upvote. Your post will be hidden by the moderators if it does not meet the posting guidelines, in which case your hunt will be delisted from the ranking board. Posts may not be processed before the cutoff time. In this scenario your post will automatically roll over to the next day's competition and will be verified that day.

Please note that since we can not predict every possible product, category, and/or situation, our moderation team will have the final say on all approved and/or delisted posts and will be prepared to give an explanation regarding why a product has been delisted. Our main goal is to uphold a quality posting and product standard for hunters and visitors alike and all decisions will be made with fairness and objectivity.
